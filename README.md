# HouseMate

## Project concept:

HouseMate is a website that helps poeple living together in a house manage the communal chores and stay on top of managing the household.
Each person can add tasks and complete tasks. 
When they mark items as done it is tracked and surfaced in a list of complete items and in a leaderboard for households to use as a game to put a bit more fun into household chores.


## Features:

- Add your own name
- Add new tasks
- See who has added tasks

- See how many chores each person has completed in a table
